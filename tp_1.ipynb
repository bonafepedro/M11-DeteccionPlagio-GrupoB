       " 'They\\nhad assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was\\nto take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon\\nhimself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention,\\nwithout restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.',\n",
       " 'Thus encouraged, the element but\\nlately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any\\nintervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such\\nillusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent\\ndisappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.',\n",
       " 'The provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling\\nof his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b\\nchosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.',\n",
       " 'The proclamation convening this assemblage\\nalso announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were\\nsatisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and\\nprovided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to\\nbe disloyal.',\n",
       " \"As this action of Hamilton's disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty\\noath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious\\nopposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the\\ncolored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of\\nthe war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.\",\n",
       " 'It\\nwas greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and\\nas it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless\\nthe freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon\\nreported from all parts of the State.',\n",
       " 'Hamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public\\nopinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.',\n",
       " 'As department\\ncommander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions\\nfor help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his\\nduties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.',\n",
       " 'By such\\ndisposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton,\\nand all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance\\nof an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the\\nduties of the office August 9, 1866.',\n",
       " \"One of Governor Throckmorton's first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of\\nthe military.\",\n",
       " \"This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson,\\non the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered\\ncontrol of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that\\nhad characterized the beginning of Hamilton's administration.\",\n",
       " 'Oppressive legislation in the\\nshape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross\\ninjustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and\\ndisorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till\\nCongress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation\\nof the seceded States.',\n",
       " 'In the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put\\nin operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.',\n",
       " 'This was effected under encouragement\\ngiven by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at\\nNew Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.',\n",
       " 'The constitution then agreed upon was submitted\\nto the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of\\nthe State.',\n",
       " \"The government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was\\nnever recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship\\nby the President's amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.\",\n",
       " 'The Legislature\\nwas in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President,\\non the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding\\ncivil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began\\nin Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led\\nto flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers\\nof outrages and murders.',\n",
       " 'To remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established\\nthe government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this\\nby reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening\\nunder certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, early in the\\nsummer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided\\nthat a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly\\nby B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.',\n",
       " 'Mayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action\\nas revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling\\nprevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.',\n",
       " 'A bloody\\nriot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.',\n",
       " 'I happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called\\nby affairs on the Rio Grande.',\n",
       " 'On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on\\nthe night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details\\nof the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter,\\nGeneral Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government.',\n",

       " 'In so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.',\n",
       " 'If it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder\\nmay indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then\\nthe implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which\\nwe shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade\\nby denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing\\nthe first.',\n",
       " 'How can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes?',\n",
       " 'It is no use\\nfor us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak\\nof it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as\\nwe said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest\\nit, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of\\nthe empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies\\nsomething.',\n",
       " 'But it is this analysis that we neglect to make.',\n",
       " 'We omit it, precisely because\\nit does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.',\n",
       " 'We\\nsaid, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent.',\n",
       " 'If there are two kinds of order, this\\ncontingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.',\n",
       " 'Where I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have\\nbeen geometrical.',\n",
       " 'But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of\\ndegrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to\\nme to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily\\nbelieve that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of\\nitself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which\\nthere is no order at all.\"',\n",

Dalton, and that\\nby which Sherman's army had been transferred from New Hope Church to the railroad in front\\nof Allatoona, as well as that by which Atlanta was afterward captured.\", 'Hence the existence\\nof this \"alternative\" could not have been unthought of by any of us at the time of the assault\\non Kenesaw.', 'But there was another alternative in this and similar cases, which was much discussed at various\\ntimes during the campaign.', 'Its practicability can be judged of only upon general principles,\\nfor it was never tried.', 'It was to detach two or three corps, nearly half our army (which was\\nabout double the strength of the enemy), make a detour wide enough to avoid his fortifications,\\nand strike directly at his flank and rear.', \"Such a movement, it was urged, at Dalton, Kenesaw,\\nor Atlanta would have compelled Johnston to fight a battle on equal terms with one half of\\nSherman's army, while he had to hold his parapets against the other half.\", 'Whatever else may\\nbe said of this proposed movement, it would undoubtedly have been more hazardous and much more\\ndecisive, one way or the other, than any of the plans actually adopted.', 'It certainly promised\\nsuccess proportionate to the cost, instead of a costly failure, which the assault of fortified\\nlines had almost invariably proved to be.', 'I did not see Thomas or McPherson for some days before the assault, but I believe their judgment,\\nlike mine, was opposed to it.', 'Undoubtedly it was generally opposed, though deferentially as\\nbecame subordinates toward the commanding general.', 'The responsibility was entirely Sherman\\'s,\\nas he afterward frankly stated; and I presume he did not mean to imply otherwise by the language\\nused in his \"Memoirs\" above quoted (Vol.', 'II, page 60).', \"General Sherman's orders, issued on\\nJune 24 (Special Field Orders, No.\", '28), directed each of the three armies to make an attack\\n(under the word \"assault\" for Thomas and \"attack\" for McPherson and me).', 'I had made all preparations\\nto carry out the order on my part.', \"Being visited by General Sherman a day or two before the\\ndate named for the execution of the order (June 27), I explained to him what I had done, and\\nhow little hope there was of success, on account of the smallness of my reserve to push the\\nadvantage even if we should break the line, when he at once replied that it was not intended\\nthat I should make an attack in front, but to make a strong demonstration in my front, and\\ngain what advantage I could on the enemy's flank.\", \"During the day Cox's division forced the\\npassage of Olley's Creek and secured a position on the head of Nickajack, which was spoken\\nof by Sherman as the only success of the day.\", \"TENDENCY OF VETERAN TROOPS\\n\\nThere were doubtless many occasions in the Atlanta campaign when the enemy's intrenchments\\ncould have been assaulted with success.\", 'These were when the position had been but recently\\noccupied and the fortifications were very slight.', \"After several days' occupation, as at the\\npoints attacked by Thomas and McPherson, the lines became impregnable.\", \"Frequent efforts were\\nmade, and by none more earnestly than by General Sherman, to press the troops to a vigorous\\nassault of the enemy's position under the favorable circumstances above referred to.\", 'But the\\ngeneral feeling of the army, including not only privates, but officers of nearly all grades,\\nwas undoubtedly opposed to such attacks.', 'The notion was very prevalent that there was no necessity\\nof fighting the enemy on unequal terms.', 'When attacked, either with or without cover, the troops\\nwould fight with the most determined valor, and almost invariably with success.', 'So when attacking\\nthe enemy in open ground there was no lack of energy or pluck.', 'But we lose one of the most\\nimportant lessons of the war if we fail to remember and appreciate the fact that our veteran\\ntroops are very loath to make an attack where they believe they have not a fair chance of success.', 'This feeling must be attributed, not to a lack of high soldierly qualities, but to intelligence\\nand good sense.', 'The veteran American soldier fights very much as he has been accustomed to\\nwork his farm or run his sawmill:  He wants to see a fair prospect that it is \"going to pay.\"', 'His loyalty, discipline, and pluck will not allow him under any circumstances to retreat without\\norders, much less to run away; but if he encounters a resistance which he thinks he cannot\\novercome, or which he thinks it would \"cost too much\" to overcome, he will lie down, cover\\nhimself with a little parapet, and hold his ground against any force that may attempt to drive\\nhim back.', 'This feeling of the soldier is an element in the problem of war which cannot be\\nignored.', 'The general who, with such an army, would win the full measure of success due to greatly\\nsuperior numbers, must manoeuver so as to compel the enemy to fight him on approximately equal\\nterms, instead of assaulting fortifications where, against modern weapons, numbers are of little\\nor no avail.', \"In the days of the bayonet successful tactics consisted in massing a superior\\nforce upon some vital point, and breaking the enemy's line.\", 'Now it is the fire of the musket,\\nnot the bayonet, that decides the battle.', 'To mass troops against the fire of a covered line\\nis simply to devote them to destruction.', 'The greater the mass, the greater the loss--that is\\nall.', 'A large mass has no more chance of success than a small one.', 'That this is absolutely\\ntrue since the introduction of breech-loaders is probably not doubted by any one; and it was\\nvery nearly true with the muzzle- loading rifles used during our late war, as was abundantly\\ndemonstrated on many occasions.', \"I have always believed that the true tactics of our late war, whenever our force was double\\nthat of the enemy (as it sometimes was and always should have been at all points where decisive\\nmovements were to be made), were to throw one half the force upon the enemy's rear, so as to\\ncompel him to attack that force or else retreat by side roads with loss of trains and artillery.\", 'This would doubtless have been a bold departure from the ancient tactics, which had not yet\\nbeen proved obsolete.', 'Yet I always thought it strange that our leading generals were unwilling\\nto attempt it.', \"Had Sherman divided his army in such a way, and struck at Hood's rear, he might\\nhave found a chance to destroy that army as well as the railroads in Georgia.\", 'THE DEATH OF McPHERSON BEFORE ATLANTA\\n\\nThe death of McPherson, on July 22, was felt by all to be an irreparable loss, and by none\\nmore so than by General Sherman, who manifested deep feeling when the body was brought to the\\nHoward House, east of Atlanta.', 'I recollect well his remark to the effect that the whole of\\nthe Confederacy could not atone for the sacrifice of one such life.', 'My recollection of some of the incidents of that day differs in some respects from that of\\nGeneral Sherman.', 'As soon as it was known that the Army of the Tennessee was heavily engaged\\nI drew out of line the larger part of my troops, leaving the picket-line in position, with\\nstrong reserves behind the parapets, and massed them near my left, ready to send reinforcements\\nto the Army of the Tennessee if necessary, or to form a temporary left flank if the line on\\nmy left should be broken, as it was late in the day, as described by General Sherman.', \"( 4)\\n\\nWhen that break was made in the line immediately to the left of mine, I had a rare opportunity\\nof witnessing Sherman's splendid conduct as a simple soldier, the occasion for which occurs\\nso rarely to the general-in-chief of a great army.\", 'Sherman at once sent to me for all my artillery,\\nwhich responded to his call at a full gallop.', 'He led the batteries in person to some high,\\nopen ground in front of our line near the Howard House, placed them in position, and directed\\ntheir fire, which from that advanced position enfiladed the parapets from which our troops\\nhad been driven, and which the enemy then occupied.', 'With the aid of that terrible raking fire,\\nthe division of Union troops very quickly regained the intrenchments they had lost.', 'General\\nSherman, on page 81, Vol.', 'II, gives me the credit due to himself for that soldierly conduct\\nas an artillery commander.', \"I was occupied in forming my infantry reserve to meet the enemy\\nif Logan's troops did not drive them back.\", \"Only my artillery was used in restoring this broken\\nline, because Logan's infantry proved sufficient without further aid.\", \"This action of mine was\\ntaken with General Sherman's knowledge and approval, and was the correct thing to do, for the\\nreason that the ground in my front was such as to make both my position and that of the enemy\\npractically unassailable.\", 'I had no apprehension of an attack in my front, and there was no\\nquestion of my attempting to \"make a lodgment in Atlanta\" that day, as stated by Sherman in\\nVol.', 'II, page 80.', \"It was proposed by me that my reserve and Thomas's should go the assistance of the Army of\\nthe Tennessee, either directly or, better still, by making a counter-attack in front of the\\nright of that army, which, if successful, would cut off the hostile force then attacking in\\nleft.\", 'Sherman replied, as I recollect, that he had asked Thomas to send some troops to the\\nleft, and the latter had replied that he had none to spare.', 'Without these the proposition\\nto make a counter-attack could not be entertained.', 'But my memory is only that of conversations\\nwith General Sherman during the day, and he ought to be much better informed than I concerning\\nwhat passed between General Thomas and himself.', 'I recollect that General Sherman during the\\nday expressed something like a wish to \"let the Army of the Tennessee fight its own battle,\"\\nbut in his statement of motive for so doing I think he does that army injustice.', 'My impression\\nwas, and is, that they would have been very glad of assistance, and that timely help would\\nhave increased the fraternal feeling between the armies, instead of creating unworthy jealousy.', 'I cannot but believe, as I then thought, that we were losing a great opportunity that day.', 'A large force of the enemy had made a wide circuit from his defenses about Atlanta and attacked\\nour left several miles distant.', 'We there had a chance to fight him on equal terms.', \"I thought,\\nand still think, we ought to have concentrated a large part of Thomas's force and mine near\\nthe Howard House, and made a strong counter-attack upon this attacking column of the enemy,\\nwith the hope of cutting it off from Atlanta.\", 'Instead of this, Thomas spent the day in efforts\\nto \"make a lodgment in Atlanta\" over well-prepared fortifications which the Georgia militia\\ncould hold against him about as well as the veteran Confederate troops.', 'The movement of August 4 and 5 was designed to be substantially what had been frequently suggested,\\nbut which I have heretofore referred to as having never been tried, with the exception that\\nthe attacking force was not to sever its connection with the main body, and hence might not\\nreach far enough to strike an exposed flank of the enemy.', 'But even with this modification\\nI thought the movement ought to have a fair chance of success.', 'That movement was not suggested\\nby me in any way, and, so far as I know, not by General Thomas.', 'I believe it originated entirely\\nwith General Sherman.', 'I never heard of it until I received his orders.', 'There was no \"argument\"\\nby me of the question of relative rank, as suggested by General Sherman (Vol.', 'II, page 99).', \"SHERMAN'S ERROR IN A QUESTION OF RELATIVE RANK\\n\\nThe positions of the troops when the order for the movement was made rendered it convenient\\nthat the Twenty-third Corps be put in first,--that is, next to the right of General Thomas's\\ntroops then in position,--while the Fourteenth Corps, commanded by General John M. Palmer,\\nwas relied upon to develop rapidly to our right and endeavor to strike the enemy's flank before\\nhe could extend his intrenched line far enough to meet and resist our attack.\", 'It was not until\\nsome time after my orders for this movement had been issued and should have been in progress\\nof vigorous execution that I received the first intimation that the question of rank had been\\nraised, as stated by General Sherman, and that my orders had simply been transmitted to the\\ndivision commanders of the Fourteenth Corps.', 'It cannot for a moment be admitted that any share of the blame for that failure attaches to\\nthe Fourteenth Corps, as such.', 'Nor do I believe with General Sherman that its slowness on\\nthat occasion was due to anything \"imbibed\" from General Thomas.', \"SHERMAN'S ERROR IN A QUESTION OF RELATIVE RANK\\n\\nMy own view of military duty was different from that entertained by the commander of the Fourteenth\\nCorps, as was shown in my subsequent action, hereinafter referred to, when I was ordered to\\nreport to and act under the orders of General Stanley.\", 'But if the distinguished statesman\\nwho then commanded the Fourteenth Corps fell into error at that time, he has doubtless since\\nregretted it far more than any other man could possible do; and he has many times atoned for\\nthat error by the great services to the country which he has continued to render up to the\\npresent time.', 'The primary and principal cause of this and all similar difficulties during the Atlanta campaign\\nwas the grave error of opinion which disregarded the special rank of army and department commanders\\ngiven them by the President\\'s assignment under the law, and the still graver error of judgment\\nin leaving such an important question open until the eve of battle, in the \"hope that there\\nwould be no necessity for making this decision.\"', \"This error seems incomprehensible when it\\nis considered that it in effect nullified the President's selection of army and department\\ncommanders at the most important of all moments, the crisis of battle, by making these commanders\\nsubject to the orders of any general of older commission whose troops happened to be adjacent\\nto theirs.\", 'In the midst of battle, when the orders of a common superior cannot be obtained in time to\\nmeet an emergency, the highest commander present must give the necessary orders and must be\\nobeyed.', 'This is probably the gravest responsibility of war.', \"Yet Sherman's opinion and decision\\nwould have placed this responsibility, not upon the army commander who had been selected by\\nthe President, upon the advice of the general-in-chief, under an act of Congress passed especially\\nfor the purpose, but upon some one who through political influence or otherwise had got an\\nearlier commission of major-general.\", 'So many of the latter had proved to be unqualified for\\nresponsible command that Congress had enacted a special law authorizing the President to supersede\\nsuch prior commissions and assign commanders of armies or army corps in the field and in any\\ndepartment whom he deemed competent.', '( 5)  Palpable as this fallacy seems, yet it was adhered\\nto until overruled by the War Department.', 'It is proper for me to add that I had at that time but a very slight personal acquaintance\\nwith General Palmer.', 'However, I knew him well by reputation, and esteemed him highly.', 'General\\nThomas, especially, had given me a high estimate of his character and abilities.', 'If there\\nwas any cause of jealousy or ill-feeling between us, I never suspected it.', '[( 1) War Records, Vol.', 'XXXVIII, part iv, p.', '558.]', '[( 2) War Records, Vol.', 'XXXVIII, part iv, pp.', '566 and 568.]', '[( 3) Captain A.

Johnston told me that in\\nhis judgment Sherman's operations in Hood's rear ought not to have caused the evacuation of\\nAtlanta; that he (Johnston), when in command, had anticipated such a movement, and had prepared,\\nor intended to prepare, to oppose it by constructing artillery redoubts at all suitable points\\nin the rear of Atlanta, as well as in front, which redoubts could be very speedily connected\\nby infantry intrenchments whenever necessary; that he aimed to keep on longer than Sherman's\\narmy could subsist on the contents of their wagons and haversacks; and that Sherman could not\\npossibly hold all the railroads leading into Atlanta at the same time, nor destroy any one\\nof them so thoroughly that it could not be repaired in time to replenish Johnston's supplies\\nin Atlanta.\", 'Here is presented a question well worthy of the candid study of military critics.', \"Whatever\\nmay be the final judgment upon that question, it seems perfectly clear that Johnston's plan\\nof defense ought at least to have been tried by his successor.\", \"If Hood had kept all his troops\\nin compact order about Atlanta, he would have been in the best possible condition to resist\\nSherman if the latter turned back from Jonesboro' and attacked Atlanta from the rear, or to\\nstrike Sherman's rear or flank in full force if he made any other movement.\", \"The division of\\nHood's forces at that time, one part holding on to Atlanta while the other went to head off\\nSherman, was the worst disposition that could have been made.\", \"As related to me personally by General Sheridan,--for I have not yet studied the Virginia campaigns\\nso thoroughly as to justify me in speaking from the records,--it was a similar mistake on the\\npart of the Confederate cavalry commander J.

but through my own scouts and spies I was able\\nto keep track of Hood\\'s movements.', \"As soon as he turned westward I determined to move with\\nthe troops, when no longer necessary to the defense of Chattanooga, rapidly to Trenton and\\nValley Head, seize the passes through the Lookout range, and prevent Hood's escape in that\\ndirection, presuming that Sherman would intercept his retreat down the Chattanooga valley.\", 'I sent a courier to General Sherman informing him of my purpose, and informed General Thomas\\nby telegraph.', \"But the latter disapproved my plan, and directed me to move to defend Caperton's\\nFerry.\", 'This is what General Sherman refers to in his despatch of October 16:  \"Your first\\nmove on Trenton and Valley Head was right; the move to defend Caperton\\'s Ferry is wrong.', 'Notify\\nGeneral Thomas of these, my views.\"', 'But the difference between right and wrong proved immaterial,\\nsince Hood was left free to escape down the Chattanooga valley.', \"Why this was done, or why\\nSherman did not want to force the enemy east, by Spring Place, into the barren mountains, where\\nJohnston would have been compelled to go if McPherson's move on Resaca in May had been successful,\\nseems a mystery.\", \"The explanation is probably to be found in Sherman's wish that Hood would\\ngo where he would not be compelled to follow, and thus would leave him (Sherman) a clear road\\nfor his march to the sea.\", 'Indeed the conviction seems irresistible that Sherman and Hood could\\nhardly have acted in more perfect concert if they had been under the same commander.', 'The one\\ndid exactly what the other wanted, and the other took care not to interfere with his movement.', 'At the close of the Atlanta campaign, I promised General Sherman that I would, as soon as I\\nshould be able to do so, write a full critical history of that campaign as a text-book for\\nmilitary students.', 'I have not yet found time to fulfil that promise.', 'The foregoing pages\\nwere intended, when written, as only a very partial fulfilment of that task, and that almost\\nentirely of one side of it--far the most difficult side.', 'The other side is so easy, comparatively,\\nand is already so familiar to military students, that further elucidation now seems hardly\\nnecessary.', 'Yet I hope, as a labor of love, if for no other reason, to present my impressions\\nof those grand tactical evolutions of a compact army of one hundred thousand men, as I witnessed\\nthem with the intense interest of a young commander and student of the great art which has\\nso often in the history of the world determined the destinies of nations.', \"HOOD'S OPERATIONS IN SHERMAN'S REAR\\n\\nAfter the capture of Atlanta, in September, 1864, General Sherman proposed to give his army\\nrest for a month while he perfected his plans and preparations for a change of base to some\\npoint on the Atlantic or the gulf, in pursuance of the general plan outlined by General Grant\\nbefore the Atlanta campaign was opened in May.\", \"But the Confederate commander took the initiative,\\nabout September 20, by moving his army around Sherman's right, striking his railroad about\\nAllatoona and toward Chattanooga, doing some damage, and then marching off westward with the\\ndesign of transferring the theater of war from Georgia to Alabama, Mississippi, or Tennessee.\", 'Sherman very promptly decided not to accept that challenge to meet Hood upon a field chosen\\nby the latter, but to continue substantially the original plan for his own operations, having\\nin view also new ulterior plans opened to him by this erratic movement of his adversary.', 'An\\nessential modification of the original plan, to meet the unexpected movement of Hood, was to\\nsend back into Tennessee force enough, in addition to the troops then there and others to be\\nassembled from the rear, to cope with Hood in the event of his attempting the invasion of Tennessee\\nand Kentucky, or to pursue and occupy his attention if he should attempt to follow Sherman.', \"General George H. Thomas, commanding the Department of the Cumberland, whose headquarters were\\nat Nashville, was already at that place, and was directed by General Sherman to assume command\\nof all the troops in the three departments under Sherman's command, except those with the latter\\nin Georgia, and to direct the operations against Hood.\", 'Thomas had in his department at that time only the garrisons and railroad guards which had\\nbeen deemed essential during the preceding operations in Georgia; and many of those were soon\\nto be discharged by expiration of their terms of enlistment, their places to be supplied by\\nnew regiments coming from the rear.', \"General A. J. Smith's corps, then in Missouri, about ten\\nthousand strong, was ordered to Tennessee, and Sherman also ordered Stanley, with the Fourth\\nCorps, about twelve thousand men, to return from Georgia to Tennessee and report to Thomas.\", \"Stanley had started by rail to Tullahoma, and was to march, as he did, from the latter point\\nto Pulaski, Tennessee, which had been selected as the point of concentration for Thomas's forces.\", 'This was the situation when I returned to the army and reported in person to General Sherman.', \"Under Sherman's promise of a month's rest for his army, I had gone back to attend to the business\\nof my department, as General Thomas had also done, and hence was in the rear when Hood made\\nhis raid upon Sherman's railroad.\", 'Upon reporting to General Sherman near the end of October,\\nI learned for the first time his purpose to march to Savannah, and what troops he had provided\\nfor Thomas in Tennessee.', \"I told Sherman, with that perfect candor which he always invited,\\nthat in my opinion Thomas's force was much too small; that Hood evidently intended to invade\\nTennessee; and that he would not be diverted from his purpose by Sherman's march in the opposite\\ndirection, but would, on the contrary, be encouraged thereby to pursue his own plan.\", 'Hence\\nI requested Sherman to send me back with the Twenty-third Corps to join Thomas.', 'Sherman at\\nfirst appeared to understand my suggestions as a desire to be left in Tennessee instead of\\nThomas, the latter to go with Sherman.', 'But I explained to him emphatically that such was not\\nmy thought.', \"I took it for granted that Thomas was to command the army in Tennessee, and I\\nwanted only to go back and help him because he would, in my opinion, have to do the fighting\\nwhile Sherman's march would be unopposed.\", 'Sherman then replied that he must have three grand\\ndivisions, under Slocum, Howard, and myself, to make his army complete, and that he could not\\nspare me; and he gave no indication of concurrence in my opinion that he ought to send back\\nmore troops.', \"SENT BACK TO THOMAS'S AID\\n\\nAfter leaving General Sherman that afternoon and returning to my own camp, I wrote him a letter\\ngiving a special reason why my corps, rather than any other, should be sent back to Tennessee\\nin order that it might be filled up my new regiments which had been ordered from the North.\", \"No answer came to these suggestions until I had made three days' march toward Atlanta, en route\\nfor Savannah.\", 'Then I received an order, October 30, to march to the nearest point on the railroad,\\nand report by telegraph to General Thomas for orders.', 'At first General Thomas ordered me to move by rail to Tullahoma, and then march across to Pulaski,\\nas Stanley was doing.', 'But just then Forrest with his cavalry appeared at Johnsonville, on\\nthe Tennessee River west of Nashville, and destroyed a great quantity of property, General\\nThomas not having sufficient force available to oppose him; hence on November 3 Thomas ordered\\nme to come at once by rail to Nashville with my corps, where I reported to him with the advance\\nof my troops on November 5.', 'He then ordered me to go at once with some of my troops to Johnsonville\\nand dispose of the Confederate cavalry there, and then to return to Nashville and proceed to\\nPulaski, to take command of all the troops in the field, which would then include the Fourth\\nCorps, my own Twenty- third, except the detachment left at Johnsonville, and the cavalry watching\\nHood toward Florence.', 'My duty at Johnsonville, where I left two brigades, was soon disposed\\nof; and I then returned to Nashville, and went at once by rail to Pulaski, arriving at that\\nplace in the evening of November 13.', \"Some so-called histories of the Tennessee campaign have been based upon the theory that I was\\nmarching from Georgia to Tennessee, to unite my corps with General Thomas's army at Nashville,\\nwhen I encountered Hood at Franklin, and after a sharp contest managed to elude him and continue\\nmy march and unite with the Army of the Cumberland at Nashville.\", 'Hence I wish to point out\\nclearly that I had been with the entire Twenty-third Corps to Nashville, with a part of it\\nto Johnsonville and back to Nashville, and thence to Columbia and near Pulaski, all by rail;\\nthat all of the Army of the Cumberland then in Tennessee was the Fourth Corps and the cavalry\\nat and near Pulaski; that General Thomas placed those troops under my command, and that they\\nremained so until after the battle of Franklin, November 30, and the retreat to Nashville that\\nnight; and that General Thomas did not have an army at Nashville until December 1.', \"I had united\\nwith Thomas's troops two weeks before the battle of Franklin, and was commanding his army in\\nthe field as well as my own during that time.\", 'If the historians had read the records ( 1)\\nthey could not possibly have fallen into such a mistake.', \"FAULTY INSTRUCTIONS TO OPPOSE HOOD AT PULASKI\\n\\nBefore reaching Pulaski I was furnished with an order from General Thomas's headquarters assigning\\nme to the command in the field, by virtue of my rank as a department commander, and a copy\\nof instructions which had already been telegraphed to General Stanley at Pulaski.\", 'I assumed\\ncommand in the morning of November 14.', \"The moment I met Stanley at Pulaski, in the evening\\nof November 13, he called my attention to the faulty position of the troops and to an error\\nin General Thomas's instructions, about which I then knew nothing because I was unacquainted\\nwith the geography of the surrounding country.\", \"Upon Stanley's statement, I halted Cox's division\\nof the Twenty-third Corps a few miles north of Pulaski so that the troops might be the more\\nreadily placed as the situation required when I had time to consider it.\", 'No part of the Twenty-third\\nCorps actually went to Pulaski, although that was the place to which General Thomas had ordered it.']\n",

they knew that no large enemy\\nraid could have occurred, and they knew that no sizeable store of explosives was in Hiroshima\\nat that time.', 'A young officer of the Japanese General Staff was instructed to fly immediately\\nto Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for\\nthe staff.', 'It was generally felt at Headquarters that nothing serious had taken place, that\\nit was all a terrible rumor starting from a few sparks of truth.', 'The staff officer went to the airport and took off for the southwest.', 'After flying for about\\nthree hours, while still nearly 100 miles from Hiroshima, he and his pilot saw a great cloud\\nof smoke from the bomb.', 'In the bright afternoon, the remains of Hiroshima were burning.', 'Their plane soon reached the city, around which they circled in disbelief.', 'A great scar on\\nthe land, still burning, and covered by a heavy cloud of smoke, was all that was left of a\\ngreat city.', 'They landed south of the city, and the staff officer immediately began to organize\\nrelief measures, after reporting to Tokyo.', \"Tokyo's first knowledge of what had really caused the disaster came from the White House public\\nannouncement in Washington sixteen hours after Hiroshima had been hit by the atomic bomb.\", 'Nagasaki\\n\\nNagasaki had never been subjected to large scale bombing prior to the explosion of the atomic\\nbomb there.', 'On August 1st, 1945, however, a number of high explosive bombs were dropped on\\nthe city.', 'A few of these bombs hit in the shipyards and dock areas in the southwest portion\\nof the city.', 'Several of the bombs hit the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works and six bombs landed\\nat the Nagasaki Medical School and Hospital, with three direct hits on buildings there.', 'While\\nthe damage from these few bombs were relatively small, it created considerable concern in Nagasaki\\nand a number of people, principally school children, were evacuated to rural areas for safety,\\nthus reducing the population in the city at the time of the atomic attack.', 'On the morning of August 9th, 1945, at about 7:50 A.M., Japanese time, an air raid alert was\\nsounded in Nagasaki, but the \"All clear\" signal was given at 8:30.', 'When only two B-29 superfortresses\\nwere sighted at 10:53 the Japanese apparently assumed that the planes were only on reconnaissance\\nand no further alarm was given.', \"A few moments later, at 11:00 o'clock, the observation B-29\\ndropped instruments attached to three parachutes and at 11:02 the other plane released the\\natomic bomb.\", 'The bomb exploded high over the industrial valley of Nagasaki, almost midway between the Mitsubishi\\nSteel and Arms Works, in the south, and the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works (Torpedo Works),\\nin the north, the two principal targets of the city.', 'Despite its extreme importance, the first bombing mission on Hiroshima had been almost routine.', 'The second mission was not so uneventful.', 'Again the crew was specially trained and selected;\\nbut bad weather introduced some momentous complications.', \"These complications are best described\\nin the brief account of the mission's weaponeer, Comdr., now Capt., F. L.  Ashworth, U.S.N.,\\nwho was in technical command of the bomb and was charged with the responsibility of insuring\\nthat the bomb was successfully dropped at the proper time and on the designated target.\", 'His\\nnarrative runs as follows:\\n\\n\"The night of our take-off was one of tropical rain squalls, and flashes of lightning stabbed\\ninto the darkness with disconcerting regularity.', 'The weather forecast told us of storms all\\nthe way from the Marianas to the Empire.', 'Our rendezvous was to be off the southeast coast\\nof Kyushu, some 1500 miles away.', \"There we were to join with our two companion observation\\nB-29's that took off a few minutes behind us.\", 'Skillful piloting and expert navigation brought\\nus to the rendezvous without incident.', '\"About five minutes after our arrival, we were joined by the first of our B-29\\'s.', 'The second,\\nhowever, failed to arrive, having apparently been thrown off its course by storms during the\\nnight.', 'We waited 30 minutes and then proceeded without the second plane toward the target area.', '\"During the approach to the target the special instruments installed in the plane told us that\\nthe bomb was ready to function.', 'We were prepared to drop the second atomic bomb on Japan.', 'But fate was against us, for the target was completely obscured by smoke and haze.', 'Three times\\nwe attempted bombing runs, but without success.', 'Then with anti-aircraft fire bursting around\\nus and with a number of enemy fighters coming up after us, we headed for our secondary target,\\nNagasaki.', '\"The bomb burst with a blinding flash and a huge column of black smoke swirled up toward us.', 'Out of this column of smoke there boiled a great swirling mushroom of gray smoke, luminous\\nwith red, flashing flame, that reached to 40,000 feet in less than 8 minutes.', 'Below through\\nthe clouds we could see the pall of black smoke ringed with fire that covered what had been\\nthe industrial area of Nagasaki.', '\"By this time our fuel supply was dangerously low, so after one quick circle of Nagasaki, we\\nheaded direct for Okinawa for an emergency landing and refueling\".', 'GENERAL COMPARISON OF HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI\\n\\nIt was not at first apparent to even trained observers visiting the two Japanese cities which\\nof the two bombs had been the most effective.', 'In some respects, Hiroshima looked worse than Nagasaki.', 'The fire damage in Hiroshima was much\\nmore complete; the center of the city was hit and everything but the reinforced concrete buildings\\nhad virtually disappeared.', 'A desert of clear-swept, charred remains, with only a few strong\\nbuilding frames left standing was a terrifying sight.', 'At Nagasaki there were no buildings just underneath the center of explosion.', 'The damage to\\nthe Mitsubishi Arms Works and the Torpedo Works was spectacular, but not overwhelming.', 'There\\nwas something left to see, and the main contours of some of the buildings were still normal.', 'An observer could stand in the center of Hiroshima and get a view of the most of the city;\\nthe hills prevented a similar overall view in Nagasaki.', \"Hiroshima impressed itself on one's\\nmind as a vast expanse of desolation; but nothing as vivid was left in one's memory of Nagasaki.\", 'When the observers began to note details, however, striking differences appeared.', 'Trees were\\ndown in both cities, but the large trees which fell in Hiroshima were uprooted, while those\\nin Nagasaki were actually snapped off.', 'A few reinforced concrete buildings were smashed at\\nthe center in Hiroshima, but in Nagasaki equally heavy damage could be found 2,300 feet from\\nX.', 'In the study of objects which gave definite clues to the blast pressure, such as squashed\\ntin cans, dished metal plates, bent or snapped poles and like, it was soon evident that the\\nNagasaki bomb had been much more effective than the Hiroshima bomb.', 'In the description of\\ndamage which follows, it will be noted that the radius for the amount of damage was greater\\nin Nagasaki than Hiroshima.', \"GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE ATOMIC EXPLOSIONS\\n\\nIn considering the devastation in the two cities, it should be remembered that the cities'\\ndifferences in shape and topography resulted in great differences in the damages.\", 'Hiroshima\\nwas all on low, flat ground, and was roughly circular in shape; Nagasaki was much cut up by\\nhills and mountain spurs, with no regularity to its shape.', 'In Hiroshima almost everything up to about one mile from X was completely destroyed, except\\nfor a small number (about 50) of heavily reinforced concrete buildings, most of which were\\nspecially designed to withstand earthquake shock, which were not collapsed by the blast; most\\nof these buildings had their interiors completely gutted, and all windows, doors, sashes, and\\nframes ripped out.', 'In Nagasaki, nearly everything within 1/2 mile of the explosion was destroyed,\\nincluding heavy structures.', 'All Japanese homes were destroyed within 1 1/2 miles from X.', 'Underground air raid shelters with earth cover roofs immediately below the explosion had their\\nroofs caved in; but beyond 1/2 mile from X they suffered no damage.', 'In Nagasaki, 1500 feet from X high quality steel frame buildings were not completely collapsed,\\nbut the entire buildings suffered mass distortion and all panels and roofs were blown in.', 'In Nagasaki, 2,000 feet from X, reinforced concrete buildings with 10\" walls and 6\" floors\\nwere collapsed; reinforced concrete buildings with 4\" walls and roofs were standing but were\\nbadly damaged.', 'At 2,000 feet some 9\" concrete walls were completely destroyed.', 'In Nagasaki, 3,500 feet from X, church buildings with 18\" brick walls were completely destroyed.', '12\" brick walls were severely cracked as far as 5,000 feet.', 'In Hiroshima, 4,400 feet from X, multi-story brick buildings were completely demolished.', 'In\\nNagasaki, similar buildings were destroyed to 5,300 feet.', 'In Hiroshima, roof tiles were bubbled (melted) by the flash heat out to 4,000 feet from X;\\nin Nagasaki, the same effect was observed to 6,500 feet.', 'In Hiroshima, steel frame buildings were destroyed 4,200 feet from X, and to 4,800 feet in\\nNagasaki.', 'In both cities, the mass distortion of large steel buildings was observed out to 4,500 feet from X.', 'In Nagasaki, reinforced concrete smoke stacks with 8\" walls, specially designed to withstand\\nearthquake shocks, were overturned up to 4,000 feet from X.', 'In Hiroshima, steel frame buildings suffered severe structural damage up to 5,700 feet from\\nX, and in Nagasaki the same damage was sustained as far as 6,000 feet.', 'In Nagasaki, 9\" brick walls were heavily cracked to 5,000 feet, were moderately cracked to\\n6,000 feet, and slightly cracked to 8,000 feet.', 'In both cities, light concrete buildings collapsed\\nout to 4,700 feet.', 'In Hiroshima, multi-story brick buildings suffered structural damage up to 6,600 feet, and\\nin Nagasaki up to 6,500 feet from X.', 'In both cities overhead electric installations were destroyed up to 5,500 feet; and trolley\\ncars were destroyed up to 5,500 feet, and damaged to 10,500 feet.', 'Flash ignition of dry, combustible material was observed as far as 6,400 feet from X in Hiroshima,\\nand in Nagasaki as far as 10,000 feet from X.', 'Severe damage to gas holders occured out to 6,500 feet in both cities.', 'All Japanese homes were seriously damaged up to 6,500 feet in Hiroshima, and to 8,000 feet\\nin Nagasaki.', 'Most Japanese homes were damaged up to 8,000 feet in Hiroshima and 10,500 feet\\nin Nagasaki.', 'The hillsides in Nagasaki were scorched by the flash radiation of heat as far as 8,000 feet\\nfrom X; this scorching gave the hillsides the appearance of premature autumn.', 'In Nagasaki, very heavy plaster damage was observed in many buildings up to 9,000 feet; moderate\\ndamage was sustained as far as 12,000 feet, and light damage up to 15,000 feet.', 'The flash charring of wooden telegraph poles was observed up to 9,500 feet from X in Hiroshima,\\nand to 11,000 feet in Nagasaki; some reports indicate flash burns as far as 13,000 feet from\\nX in both places.', 'Severe displacement of roof tiles was observed up to 8,000 feet in Hiroshima, and to 10,000\\nfeet in Nagasaki.', 'In Nagasaki, very heavy damage to window frames and doors was observed up to 8,000 feet, and\\nlight damage up to 12,000 feet.', 'Roofs and wall coverings on steel frame buildings were destroyed out to 11,000 feet.', 'Although the sources of many fires were difficult to trace accurately, it is believed that\\nfires were started by primary heat radiation as far as 15,000 feet from X.', 'Roof damage extended as far as 16,000 feet from X in Hiroshima and in Nagasaki.', 'The actual collapse of buildings was observed at the extreme range of 23,000 feet from X in\\nNagasaki.', 'Although complete window damage was observed only up to 12,000 feet from X, some window damage\\noccurred in Nagasaki up to 40,000 feet, and actual breakage of glass occured up to 60,000 feet.', 'Heavy fire damage was sustained in a circular area in Hiroshima with a mean radius of about\\n6,000 feet and a maximum radius of about 11,000 feet; similar heavy damage occured in Nagasaki\\nsouth of X up to 10,000 feet, where it was stopped on a river course.', \"In Hiroshima over 60,000 of 90,000 buildings were destroyed or severely damaged by the atomic\\nbomb; this figure represents over 67% of the city's structures.\", 'In Nagasaki 14,000 or 27% of 52,000 residences were completely destroyed and 5,400, or 10%\\nwere half destroyed.', 'Only 12% remained undamaged.', 'This destruction was limited by the layout\\nof the city.', 'The following is a summary of the damage to buildings in Nagasaki as determined\\nfrom a ground survey made by the Japanese:\\n\\n  Destruction of Buildings and Houses          Number     Percentage\\n  (Compiled by Nagasaki Municipality)\\n\\n  Total in Nagasaki (before atomic explosion)  50,000     100.0\\n  Blasted (not burned)                          2,652       5.3\\n  Blasted and burned                           11,494      23.0\\n  Blasted and/or burned                        14,146      28.3\\n  Partially burned or blasted                   5,441      10.9\\n  Total buildings and houses destroyed         19,587      39.2\\n  Undamaged                                    30,413      60.8\\n\\nIn Hiroshima, all utilities and transportation services were disrupted for varying lengths\\nof time.', 'In general however services were restored about as rapidly as they could be used\\nby the depleted population.', 'Through railroad service was in order in Hiroshima on 8 August,\\nand electric power was available in most of the surviving parts on 7 August, the day after\\nthe bombing.', 'The reservoir of the city was not damaged, being nearly 2 miles from X.', 'However,\\n70,000 breaks in water pipes in buildings and dwellings were caused by the blast and fire effects.', 'Rolling transportation suffered extensive damage.', 'The damage to railroad tracks, and roads\\nwas comparatively small, however.', 'The electric power transmission and distribution systems\\nwere badly wrecked.', 'The telephone system was approximately 80% damaged, and no service was\\nrestored until 15 August.', 'Despite the customary Japanese lack of attention to sanitation measures, no major epidemic\\nbroke out in the bombed cities.', 'Although the conditions following the bombings makes this\\nfact seem surprising, the experience of other bombed cities in both Germany and Japan show\\nHiroshima and Nagasaki not to be isolated cases.', 'The atomic explosion over Nagasaki affected an over-all area of approximately 42.9 square miles\\nof which about 8.5 square miles were water and only about 9.8 square miles were built up, the\\nremainder being partially settled.', 'Approximately 36% of the built up areas were seriously\\ndamaged.', 'The area most severely damaged had an average radius of about 1 mile, and covered\\nabout 2.9 square miles of which 2.4 were built up.', 'In Nagasaki, buildings with structural steel frames, principally the Mitsubishi Plant as far\\nas 6,000 feet from X were severely damaged; these buildings were typical of wartime mill construction\\nin America and Great Britain, except that some of the frames were somewhat less substantial.', 'The damage consisted of windows broken out (100%), steel sashes ripped out or bent, corrugated\\nmetal or corrugated asbestos roofs and sidings ripped off, roofs bent or destroyed, roof trusses\\ncollapsed, columns bent and cracked and concrete foundations for columns rotated.', 'Damage to\\nbuildings with structural steel frames was more severe where the buildings received the effect\\nof the blast on their sides than where the blast hit the ends of buildings, because the buildings\\nhad more stiffness (resistance to negative moment at the top of columns) in a longitudinal\\ndirection.', 'Many of the lightly constructed steel frame buildings collapsed completely while\\nsome of the heavily constructed (to carry the weight of heavy cranes and loads) were stripped\\nof roof and siding, but the frames were only partially injured.', 'The next most seriously damaged area in Nagasaki lies outside the 2.9 square miles just described,\\nand embraces approximately 4.2 square miles of which 29% was built up.', 'The damage from blast\\nand fire was moderate here, but in some sections (portions of main business districts) many\\nsecondary fires started and spread rapidly, resulting in about as much over-all destruction\\nas in areas much closer to X.', 'An area of partial damage by blast and fire lies just outside the one just described and comprises\\napproximately 35.8 square miles.', 'Of this area, roughly 1/6th was built up and 1/4th was water.', 'The extent of damage varied from serious (severe damage to roofs and windows in the main business\\nsection of Nagasaki, 2.5 miles from X), to minor (broken or occasionally broken windows at\\na distance of 7 miles southeast of X).', 'As intended, the bomb was exploded at an almost ideal location over Nagasaki to do the maximum\\ndamage to industry, including the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works, the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance\\nWorks (Torpedo Works), and numerous factories, factory training schools, and other industrial\\nestablishments, with a minimum destruction of dwellings and consequently, a minimum amount\\nof casualties.', 'Had the bomb been dropped farther south, the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works\\nwould not have been so severely damaged, but the main business and residential districts of\\nNagasaki would have sustained much greater damage casualties.', 'Calculations show that the structural steel and reinforced concrete frames which survived the\\nblast fairly close to X could not have withstood the estimated peak pressures developed against\\nthe total areas presented by the sides and roof of the buildings.', 'The survival of these frames\\nis explained by the fact that they were not actually required to withstand the peak pressure\\nbecause the windows were quickly knocked out and roof and siding stripped off thereby reducing\\ntotal area and relieving the pressure.', 'While this saved the building frame, it permitted severe\\ndamage to building interior and contents, and injuries to the building occupants.', 'Buildings\\nwithout large panel openings through which the pressure could dissipate were completely crushed,\\neven when their frames were as strong as those which survived.', 'The damage sustained by reinforced concrete buildings depended both on the proximity to X and\\nthe type and strength of the reinforced concrete construction.', 'Some of the buildings with\\nreinforced concrete frames also had reinforced concrete walls, ceilings, and partitions, while\\nothers had brick or concrete tile walls covered either with plaster or ornamental stone, with\\npartitions of metal, glass, and plaster.', 'With the exception of the Nagasaki Medical School\\nand Hospital group, which was designed to withstand earthquakes and was therefore of heavier\\nconstruction than most American structures, most of the reinforced concrete structures could\\nbe classified only as fair, with concrete of low strength and density, with many of the columns,\\nbeams, and slabs underdesigned and improperly reinforced.', 'These facts account for some of\\nthe structural failures which occured.', 'In general, the atomic bomb explosion damaged all windows and ripped out, bent, or twisted\\nmost of the steel window or door sashes, ripped doors from hinges, damaged all suspended wood,\\nmetal, and plaster ceilings.', 'The blast concussion also caused great damage to equipment by\\ntumbling and battering.', 'Fires generally of secondary origin consumed practically all combustible\\nmaterial, caused plaster to crack off, burned all wooden trim, stair covering, wooden frames\\nof wooden suspended ceilings, beds, mattresses, and mats, and fused glass, ruined all equipment\\nnot already destroyed by the blast, ruined all electrical wiring, plumbing, and caused spalling\\nof concrete columns and beams in many of the rooms.', 'Almost without exception masonry buildings of either brick or stone within the effective limits\\nof the blast were severely damaged so that most of them were flattened or reduced to rubble.', 'The wreckage of a church, approximately 1,800 feet east of X in Nagasaki, was one of the few\\nmasonry buildings still recognizable and only portions of the walls of this structure were\\nleft standing.', 'These walls were extremely thick (about 2 feet).', 'The two domes of the church\\nhad reinforced concrete frames and although they were toppled, they held together as units.', 'Practically every wooden building or building with timber frame within 2.0 miles of X was either\\ncompletely destroyed or very seriously damaged, and significant damage in Nagasaki resulted\\nas far as 3 miles from X.', 'Nearly all such buildings collapsed and a very large number were\\nconsumed by fire.']\n",
